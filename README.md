# Finite-State-Machine-FSM-design-using-SystemC
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) in SystemC, where the FSM transitions through 11 states (S0 to S10) based on an input signal (Input). The FSM uses a clock (CLK) for synchronization and a reset signal (RESET) to initialize the states. When the FSM reaches S10 and Input becomes SC_LOGIC_0, the output signal (Op) is set to SC_LOGIC_1. The testbench simulates the FSM, toggles the input and clock signals, and generates a VCD file to trace signal transitions, which can be visualized for verification of FSM behavior.
